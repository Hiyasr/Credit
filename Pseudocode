#pseudocode

Get Input:

Prompt user for a credit card number.
Ensure the input is numeric and doesn't have leading zeros.
Luhnâ€™s Algorithm:

Initialize two sums: sum1 for digits to be multiplied by 2, sum2 for digits not multiplied by 2.
For each digit in the credit card number, starting from the end:
If the position is even (considering the end as position 1):
Multiply the digit by 2.
If the result is greater than 9, add the digits of the result to sum1.
Else, add the result directly to sum1.
If the position is odd:
Add the digit directly to sum2.
Calculate the total sum: total = sum1 + sum2.
Check if the total modulo 10 is 0:
If yes, the number is potentially valid.
If no, the number is invalid.
Check Card Type:

Determine the length of the credit card number.
Check the starting digits to determine the card type:
If length is 15 and starts with 34 or 37, it's an American Express (AMEX).
If length is 16 and starts with 51, 52, 53, 54, or 55, it's a MasterCard.
If length is 13 or 16 and starts with 4, it's a Visa.
If none of the conditions match, the card type is invalid.
Output:

Print the determined card type or "INVALID"
